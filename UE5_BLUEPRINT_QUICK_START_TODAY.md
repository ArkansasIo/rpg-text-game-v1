   - ? Do backup weekly

3. **Not testing as you go**
   - ? Don't wait until the end to test
   - ? Do test each blueprint before saving

4. **Not following naming conventions**
   - ? Don't use random names
   - ? Do use BP_, WBP_, ABP_, etc.

5. **Not documenting code**
   - ? Don't leave code unexplained
   - ? Do add comments to functions

6. **Not organizing saves**
   - ? Don't throw all blueprints in root
